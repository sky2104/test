When applying for any dream job, there are invariably three main things you need:

Previous experience
A resume
Interview skills
While a resume is not something that alone guarantees any job, it’s definitely a big part of any recruiting process, and many people have spent countless hours trying to best present themselves on a piece of paper for that chance to interview.

Their effort is usually worth it. A good resume gets good results – it will increase your chance to interview in noticeable ways.

While the entire hiring process depends on factors like industry, stage of the company, current market demand, and difficulty of the position, defining factors of a “good resume” largely overlap regardless of what you are applying for. I’ve seen this first-hand over the past few years; my last few years have encompassed everything from reviewing thousands of resumes for technical events, to working on an EdTech startup who sold a resume collection and analysis platform, to helping junior and senior job seekers personally revamp their resume. I’ve easily looked at 10,000 resumes in the past 4 years. At this point it becomes easy to notice the large overlap between good, well performing resumes that yield interviews, as well as similarities between poorly put together resumes that get screened out.

Because most good resumes share so many common elements, I’m going to spend the time trying to break down what makes a successful resume, discuss how to avoid having a bad resume, and outline frameworks for making a solid resume for yourself.


The first question — Where are you using this resume?
In general, there are probably two places you will use a resume:

In person events (career fairs, hiring events, competitions, etc)
Online applications
The process for these two pipelines is a bit different, and can potentially change how you might want to approach your resume.

Understanding online “Applicant Tracking Systems”
The first thing to understand about applying online is that most medium to large companies use Applicant Tracking Systems, also abbreviated to ATS. These systems receive all of the data you type into the job application, and oftentimes filter candidates immediately after applying. If you pass the automated screens that may be in place, the ATS will have a person look over your profile and contact you if they see a potential fit.

Because many companies use ATS, this means that your resume needs to be parseable. That is, when an ATS scans through your resume, what does it see?

The first level of this is making sure that the text does not become garbled during the process. Although most resumes don’t have this issue, some with unique characters, multiple columns, unusual indentation, or images can translate into odd results.

An easy check is to use a “pdf to txt” converter. If this simple website that scans PDF documents outputs a text file that doesn’t read correctly (words are jumbled, strange symbols appear, etc.) then you might want to remake your resume. If you don’t want to use the one I linked, make sure you don’t choose a highly sophisticated option. Most ATS don’t use OCR or trained models for their categorization, so you shouldn’t expect things will work well. (If you don’t know what that means, just stick to my link and ignore.)

Another possible check is to look at a company that uses a platform like Lever to auto-populate your application form when you upload your resume. If things aren’t filled in correctly, you might want to try debugging the issue.

I know some people have a problem with text parsing because they make their resumes in Photoshop, which is not a tool meant for making PDF documents. If you want something very artsy, use InDesign. It isn’t hard to pick up how to use it if you already know Photoshop.

Side note – notice how I’m only using PDF as the example for your resume file. That’s because PDF is the only format you should share your resume in. Not .doc, not .docx, not .odt, not a Google Doc link… only PDF.

Find just the right words
Once you know a machine can scan your resume properly, you should start thinking about word choice. The best place for this is the job application itself. A lot of people don’t read through the full job request, but chances are it has a lot of specific technical words or previous experience required. Many companies do a first check for these things by simply seeing if the phrase is present somewhere in the resume’s text.

Even if this isn’t done by a machine at every company, many companies unfortunately have recruiters or hiring agencies source candidates with skillsets they don’t remotely understand. I’ve seen people be told by recruiters they aren’t fit for a job because they used a synonym for the skill the company is looking for. Think on the level of: “We are looking for someone who can build homes, not houses.” It’s a cruel world we live in, but if you want the job, just make sure your language matches the job requirement. Whether it be machine or human, if there isn’t a sufficient understanding of the field, you need to make sure you speak the same language as who/what-ever is looking at your resume.

The Skills Section
A natural solution to this situation is to have a “Skills” section on your resume. Put all the buzzwords in one place and get it over with. That works sometimes, but other times can come across as naive depending on what you list. If you say you have 40 skills, no one will actually read them all, and the assumption will be that you are exaggerating. Have a solid list if it makes sense (programming languages, core software tools, industry certifications) but don’t be too liberal about what you list.

If you are senior enough, a skills section may not make sense. It uses up space that has much more potential. I’d rather get a sense of the past 15 years of work you’ve done, not waste space with the entire Microsoft Office suite listed on your resume. We’ll get into this a lot more in a bit, but if possible, understanding skills in relation to experience is much more helpful.

A word for the stressed out resume writer
Wording is one of those things that can be tricky. If you aren’t having a lot of luck but you believe you truly have the skillset for the job, maybe consider spending extra time here. Or, if it is your absolute dream job that you only have one shot for, then spend the extra time. Otherwise I would say exact wording isn’t incredibly important. Don’t drain yourself obsessing over wording.

Start thinking about your resume as an advertisement.
If you are applying for a job in person, or if the company’s online pipeline has a person thoroughly examine your resume before moving to an interview, you need to worry about what it looks like.

Some people might get to this section and start rolling their eyes. “I’m a scientist/engineer/insert-technical-job-here! I don’t need to worry about graphic design!”

Well first of all, a good looking resume is not full of pictures or graphics. It is, however, incredibly readable.
